# [SunsetTimer](https://pauliusjaras.github.io/SunsetTimer/) 

This is a web application that will aks for your location and returns a timer that will show you the time until next sunset. 
If the location is denied the timer will show the next sunset in Kaunas (54.8985° N, 23.9036° E).

Made using Vanilla js and [sun.js](https://github.com/Triggertrap/sun-js) library that calculates sunset time by date and location.
